# 2404_faces

This was a project I built to recognize the faces of all the people that live in and visit my apartment.  Basically someone walks in, it recognizes their face, and says he good to see you Cyrus or whoever it was.

### HARDWARE

* Raspberry Pi
* IR camera (has night vision)
* Passive IR Sensor
* Bluetooth Speaker (not necessary, just the only speaker that I had)
* Playstation eye (again not necessary, just the only usb mic I had)
* Solid State Relay

(the IR camera isn't visible to the eye, it just shows up in the camera)
